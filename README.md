## Releases (APK)

Release APKs are published automatically to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/WorksOfNaveen/WayGoodTestApp/releases) via GitHub Actions. No GitHub CLI is required.

### Option 1: Push a version tag

```sh
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

The workflow builds the release APK and attaches `WayGoodTestApp-v1.0.0.apk` to the release.

### Option 2: Run the workflow manually

1. Open **Actions** → **Build and Release APK** in the GitHub repository.
2. Click **Run workflow**.
3. Enter a version (for example `1.0.0`) and run it.

### Build APK locally

```sh
npm install
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

The unsigned release APK is generated at:

`android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

See [CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md) for project contributors.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into build or runtime issues, see the official [React Native Troubleshooting guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/troubleshooting).

Common fixes:

- **Metro cache issues:** `npm start -- --reset-cache`
- **Android build failures:** Clean the project in Android Studio or run `cd android && ./gradlew clean`
- **iOS pod errors:** Delete `ios/Pods` and `ios/Podfile.lock`, then run `bundle exec pod install` again
